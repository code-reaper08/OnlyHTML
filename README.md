## What it does?
Most of the websites nowadays have a overwhelming amount of **CSS** in them, which makes them so pretty and user friendly. This motivated me to know, how would these websites look without **CSS**.

This gave birth to **OnlyHTML**, which removes all the CSS from the current viewing webpage.

## Usecases I think of
There are two aspects, which I think one can gain/know using this add-on.
1. **Importance of CSS**, and how it drastically improves the UI.
2. **FUN!** seriously it is quite fun to see websites without CSS.

## Available for
**OnlyHTML** browser extension is developed for both Chrome and Firefox, although Chrome version is not yet avaliable in the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)

Firefox add-on is successfully verified and available on the official [Firefox add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)

## Steps for using the extension

_**Note:**_ The only downside for this approach is, the add-on is not auto-updatable.
